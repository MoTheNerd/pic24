### Intro
So I've been thinking about deleting my facebook for a while now - I mean, it just doesn't serve much of a purpose except for providing memes and videos of my 2nd aunt's new born child...
Anyways! I wanted to create my own social media platform that took the best of apps like Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook and merge it into one. This goal is honestly quite ambitious but given the challenging circumstace, I thought to myself, "Why not? I mean it can't be all THAT bad, right?"

### Where are you in terms of project completion?
> Honestly, I haven't put much time into this since I started with iOS security research but yeahh - definitely going to start again soon since I've recently gotten the urge to get rid of my Facebook once again.

### I'm a nerd, tell me about how you hope to acheive this?
> So I'm using google's Firebase for my server's backend. I'm using a few other swift compatible APIs to actually do a bunch of things for me so I don't have to do them myself (details coming soon!).

### When will this be available?
> I'm hoping for sometime during the summer? Don't quote me on that though.

### Todo:

 - Fix Lottie Animation on load in
 - Finish firebase backend
 - Add new firebase account (because the old one kinda got killed...)
 - add camera buttons
 - add screen for friends view (probably going to do this my way because I don't like UITableViews)
 - Finish an actually decent settings page
 - WORK ON DESIGN OMG
